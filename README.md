# BrainTumorRecognition
A Brain Tumor Recognition model using VGG16, running on this dataset: [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)

The model can distinguish between meningioma, and pituitary tumor, or no tumor at all.

I have uploaded the model itself in the main branch.

The model was trained on Google Colab.
